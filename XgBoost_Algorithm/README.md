<h1> About Notebook</h1>

I have acquired this data from kaggle.
Data set is named as **Sloan Digital Sky Survey Classification
Classification of Galaxies, Stars and Quasars based on the RD14 from the SDSS.**


<h4>Context</h4>

<p>The data consists of 10,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS. Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.</p>

<h4>About Problem</h4>

<p>In this notebook I will try to classify observations of space to be either stars, galaxies or quasars. We will try to have a complete cycle of the data science workflow including querying the database to get the dataset, data analysis and building machine learning models to predict for new data. </p>

**Libraries Used**
1. Pandas
2. Numpy 
3. Seaborn
4. Sklearn
5. Matplotlib

**Algorithms Used**

I have used RandomForest Classifier and XgBoost Algorithm.
The *accuracy* of it is as follows...

<ul>
  <li>RandomForestClassifier: 99.15 </li>
  <li>XgBoost: 99.42 </li>
</ul>

**Conclusion**

It will help to understand how XgBoost works, what is its importance and improve the learning.
