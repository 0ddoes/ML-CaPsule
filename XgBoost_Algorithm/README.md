<h1> About Notebook</h1>

I have acquired this data from kaggle.

<h4>Context</h4>

<p>The data consists of 10,000 observations of space taken by the SDSS. Every observation is described by 17 feature columns and 1 class column which identifies it to be either a star, galaxy or quasar.</p>

<h4>ABout Notebook</h4>

<p>In this notebook we will try to classify observations of space to be either stars, galaxies or quasars. We will try to have a complete cycle of the data science workflow including querying the database to get the dataset, data analysis and building machine learning models to predict for new data. </p>
