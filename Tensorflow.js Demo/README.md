## PROJECT TITLE : TENSORFLOW.js DEMO USING IMAGE CLASSIFICATION

#### AIM

To classify the different images uploaded by user using the Tensorflow.js library

#### DESCRIPTION

This is a classification problem where we need to classify various images. We use Tensorflow.js Mobilenet Model.

#### MODELS USED

Tensorflow.js MobileNet Model

This TensorFlow.js model does not require you to know about machine learning. It can take as input any browser-based image elements (<img>, <video>, <canvas> elements, for example) and returns an array of most likely predictions and their confidences.

#### DEPLOYMENT

Tested on local browser, this demo can be deployed to the web like any other html applications using various deployment methods like github.io or Heroku.

#### LIBRARIES NEEDED

Tensorflow.js library can be installed via the script tag or by using npm.

#### CONCLUSION

We can conclude that our Demo App classifies images with the help of Mobilenet model from the Tensorflow.js library.
