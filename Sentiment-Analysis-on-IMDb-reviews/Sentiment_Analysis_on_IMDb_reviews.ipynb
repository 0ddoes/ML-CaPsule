It may not be perfect, but The Avengers lives up to its promise and delivers quite a punch. I feel The Avenger struggles as most superhero movies do with finding a way to naturally introduce its characters in a way that doesn't seem forced or formulaic. They do a decent job for what it is, but there are certain times you will feel the campiness of older works coming on as you view the film, and truly you just have to sit through it to get to the action that eventually will be at hand. Besides that though, there isn't many flaws. The acting is rather good, Samuel L. Jackson may take a line too seriously or too, but it's all in good fun. Again Tom Hiddleston as Loki is a major standout, and I also enjoyed the return of Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man and Chris Hemsworth Thor- as well as an improved performance by Chris Evans as Captain America and a great performance from replacement Hulk actor Mark Ruffalo. The action scenes are exciting and tense, there is some camera angles here and there that can be a bit annoying, but for the most part it is rather clear and not awfully tedious action- as many films of this type could be. In the end, despite its campiness and formulaic actions- The Avengers is an incredibly fun time. It takes pride in its stories and characters and makes the most out of an experience that could have easily been phoned in. Its a film that will live on for some time, and one i'm rather glad I got to experience first hand.My Rating: 9.4/10.\",\n",
            "            \"Can't beat the originality of uniting a superhero team! Up until this point, nothing had been done like this in film and it was executed magnificently. The casting and chemistry between them is on point, the villain is compelling and gets under your skin in the best way, and Robert Downey Jr.'s humor all around is unforgettable, and how can I not mention that glorifying theme song??\",\n",
            "            \"Awesome spectacle This review contains spoilers.The Avengers is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2012. The movie is directed by Joss Whedon, produced by Kevin Feige, screenplay by Joss Whedon. The story is written by Zak Penn, and Joss Whedon. The movie stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Tom Hiddleston. Loki launches an invasion of Earth leading the heroes of the Earth to band together and stop the invasion.The Avengers is a great action movie. The movie incorporates the grand visuals found in the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies and combines them for one spectacle featuring the heroes that we know and love. The movie focuses on the spectacle rather than having a complex narrative focusing on specific characters. In this way it is more of a large set piece with pre-existing characters rather than a full narrative movie. The spectacle is impressive to watch with the ending battle in New York City being the highlight. The scenes leading up to that moment are impressive as the heroes band and fight amongst each other. The movie is about the heroes as a whole rather than individuals.The Avengers has great chemistry with its leads. Not only does the audience see visually impressive action but also the dynamic between the superheroes. The movie relishes in the heroes it has on display and it is a treat to watch for comic book fans. Audiences can see the heroes have their quarrel and what happens when Thor's hammer hits Captain America's shield. The story concerns the heroes and it is believable that Nick Fury's Avengers squad would not get along at first. It makes for an interesting story as the squad eventually overcomes their differences and begins to work together. This is a classic trope that is applied to a superhero story.The flaw of this movie is that Loki has not been built up as a massive villain before. Loki always seemed more like a joker and a specific villain for Thor rather than a large scale villain that spanned into Iron Man and Captain America's stories. I still enjoyed Tom Hiddleston's performance and watching him on the screen is sure to delight.I would recommend The Avengers.Grade: B.\",\n",

            "            \"One of the classics, a must watch The score, the CGI, the writing, the humor, all of it is just top notch!Especially the legendary scene where Tony Stark falls out of the building and the suit activates and builds around him, not a scene to forget. The scenes where he lands at the Stark Tower landing pad and the machines automatically took off his suit is also unforgettable. How all of the agents have different plans, and how this will create conflict, but at the end, when they defeat Loki, they are together again. This movie also serves a major purpose as all of these people have met each other for the first time.If you have watched all of the other Avengers movies, it is pretty funny to see how they have grown with each other. The theme song, composed by Alan Silvestri took this movie to a whole new level. And how this theme song evolved in the later Avengers movies. Even hearing it now gives me chills.\",\n",
            "            \"A groundbreaking culmination The MCU had estavlished itself as an interesting project since the start - there were some hit and miss movies, but it was overall an imaginative concept.Then came the moment everyone had been waiting for, the big culminatiom that had been promised for years - and with Joss Wheadon at the helms, it sure doesn't disappoint.Like the MCU overall, it has a very fun and lighthearted feeling reminiscent of films like Str Wars, which is much appreciated. It is a very colourful cast of different and memorable characters, all memorized by great actors. The main antagonist Loki establishes himself as one of the most interesting and complex movie villains of all time, whether he's tragic, spiteful, mildly heroic or just pure evil, he's a joy to watch.A main draw in these movies, of course, are the effects and action scenes and they sure doesn't disappoint. The movie gives us some of the biggest and most epic scale battles ever seen on the silver screen, and it's simply mind blowing. The cinematography is incredible as well.Overall, a fun and epic movie that was years in the making and once and for all proved how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.\",\n",

The visuals are astonishing, Marvel mastered the art of implementing clever funny high quality jokes in their films and this movie is no exception, also they made good use of the 2h so that even though there are plenty of heroes in this movie they still managed to give them enough screen time so that they all feel relevant to the movie. Every action scene in this movie is important, Marvel makes sure to establish that stakes are high with a beautifully crafted smart and complex plot especially with the scene on the plane. Also the movie is full of suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat!One thing to note is that I actually enjoyed Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner I feel like he is the right man for the job.Conclusion : 10/10 !\",\n",

            "            \"Bad-ass descent-amazing superhero MCU action flick defenders of the earth my favorite Marvel's The Avengers (2012) is an awesome descent MCU superhero action flick that is spectacular and a real good one. The first time I watched it on my computer I loved it. I have seen this movie many times in the row I have this film on DVD and Blu-ray. The movie features an ensemble cast that includes Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Clark Gregg, Cobie Smulders, Stellan Skarsg\\u00e5rd, and Samuel L. Jackson. Joss Whedon did a fine job directing the film and I loved it is definitely in my top 10 favorite MCU superhero films. In the finale battle in New York the moment right there.. WILL NEVER... EVER.. BE AS COOL.. LIKE THIS WAS A COMIC MASTERPIECE.. I don't even read comics, but I did superheroes when I was younger.. I have a feeling justice league will never have this cohesion... this team work.. and will never be able to recreate this feeling.Robert Downey Jr. does a good job as a Iron Man he has a lot of good moments when he talks with Loki. In the third act he has to fight Thor that was cool then in the third act he had to do a lot of stuff, did the final stuff to safe the world. He is very much star of the film, that is why he number 1 star of the film he was payed a lot of more money then the other actors did ,but he deserved it he did a good job. Chris Evans as Captain America was spectacular I love his character I love how he defended and safe those people in the restaurant against Loki's army I thought that was descent. He does kick some ass when Thor hits him he uses his shield when SHIELD's ship was attacked he and Iron Man were trying to fix the ship I loved that. Mark Ruffalo was okay as The Hulk I thought he was better than Edward Norton's Hulk at least that is my opinion. Chris Hemsworth I liked him as Thor he was great. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was fantastic what does she do? She deals with the Hulk and Hawkeye the evil Hawkeye which I think is great. Jeremy Renner I like him a as an actor he is cool, he is mostly the bad guy in the film till the third act. In the third act he did a lot of cool stuff, he is cool with arrows. Loki he did fine the actor did fine as the villain I like him and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury did fine. In the film, Nick Fury, director of the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D., recruits Iron Man, Captain America, the Hulk, and Thor to form a team that must stop Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth.The pacing to me I thought it was little boring and it was too long but the third act was really was fast paced and the movie interested how 6 superheroes become a team who turn in to Avengers I think there was a lot of action scenes in the film that were really well done. I like special effect, I had a lot of fun scenes Hulk punching Thor or punching Loki when he said is emperor. That was fun, the film it self had a lot of action it self's. It was entertaining, the CGI was really good, Robert Downey Jr. had a lot funny moments and hilarious dialogues. I have more enjoyed Captain America because he cared more about people and of course Iron Man he saved the world from Loki's invaders. I thought it was an alright and I love it. It is definitely my favorite MARVEL superhero movie.Admittedly the first half or so isn't nearly as epic as the final 30 minutes. And the plot isn't that original. But I got what I paid for with this flick, Awesome action with Earth's Mightiest Heroes kicking alien ass.The Avengers in my honest opinion was better than Man of Steel because right next year DC superman movie come out that I have hated it and I wish I could have get the money back. I am going to try and sell the movie out. Marvel's The Avengers (classified under the name Marvel Avengers Assemble in the United Kingdom and Ireland), or simply The Avengers, is a 2012 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film was written and directed by Joss Whedon. I have reviewed 2 years the second movie twice and as a MARVEL fan I can say I have enjoyed this movie much more than Avengers: Age of Ultron. I am waiting now on Avengers: Infinity War and of course Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a spin off Captain America: Civil War like I said I have enjoy all three Captain America Films and I enjoy both Avenger films and I love Iron Man and Iron Man Three I am one of the fans that I liked that films. The rating I give is 10/10\",\n",

I thought the way they tied in parts or Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger through the Tesseract was cool. I also liked how the movie centered around Loki and his quest to rule Midgard (Earth), by stealing the Tesseract from a S. H. I. E. L. D base, taking command of Hawkeye, Selvig and Shield agents, and him teaming up with the Chitauri to attack New York and eventually the world. The story and dialogue was even good, I liked how the Avengers would always bicker together, and I also liked the punny jokes. I also loved the fact that the soul reason The Avengers decided to work together was due to the death of Coulson. Like always, the acting by everyone was great, even the new additions. Lastly, Tom Hiddleston as Loki was absolutely amazing. He played the role to perfection again. He is always great and I really hope to see a lot more of him in the future.Like I said, this was the best movie of Phase 1, I recommend this to anyone, even people who haven't seen any MCU movies before.\",\n",

My own daughter went to the premier in New York and then went to it on opening night in general release--and was mad I didn't take her with me tonight to see it! Obviously, she loved the film as well. As for me, I liked it but didn't quite share the overall exuberance for the film. Mind you, I liked it--but I think I preferred the earlier films before the Avengers team was formed. There was a certain charm that I didn't quite see recaptured in the film. Now the film is good--it's just that what I like in these other films I would have liked more of in \\\"The Avengers\\\". Specifically, the movie could have used a bit more humor and a bit more character development. When I read the IMDb trivia, it seems that originally the film had about 30 more minutes--all showing Steve Rogers (Captain America) trying to adjust to his new life. I would have LOVED seeing all this--and less of the HUGE battle at the end of the film. For me, it just felt numbing after a while and I would have liked more of the characters when they weren't fighting. Again, however, I DID like the film....but the earlier Marvel/Disney films I liked just a bit better. Just my two cents worth...\",\n",
            "            \"An Unstoppable Force of Awesomeness! All Hail The New King! I have got to tell anyone who will listen that this is one of THE best adventure movies I've ever seen. It's almost impossible to convey how pumped I am now that I've seen it. I purposefully avoid hyping myself for movies because when expectations are too high, nothing seems to be able to reach them. I usually avoid the hype train whenever possible. That said, I was jacked to see this movie and was fully aboard the hype train. It couldn't be helped. So, I was certainly open to intense disappointment had this movie not been good. I'm so happy to report just the opposite has happened.The only word I can think of to describe this movie is AWESOME. It's amazing work and everything I had hoped for and more. It's exceptional entertainment for the uninitiated but it has everything a fanboy could want to be sure. It has every little nuance of what a fanboy wants to see. One of the MANY things I loved was the tension and flat out conflict that arises between team members. It's not a two dimensional \\\"team wonderful that bands together to fight crime ho ho ho.\\\" Most don't like each other at fist and there is so much texture to be played. That is great because so many of these characters are larger than life. They have egos and the big guns aren't used to working with other people or even playing by the rules. Stark, Thor and Banner all work \\\"the other side of the fence\\\" so to speak. Then there's the Widow, Hawkeye and Captain America who are used to following orders and playing within a command structure. They are all thrown together in a wonderful and, best of all, believable fashion. Again, more than I ever dreamed possible.The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.I honestly don't want to give away ANY of the movie with this review because this is one film that needs every scene to be savored. Do yourself a favor and remain unspoiled. It's how I saw the movie (apart from what the trailers showed) and even though you're obviously reading this review, read no others with any kind of spoilers whatsoever. Experience the awesomeness for yourself. Avengers as a movie and as a team on screen is an unstoppable force. I'm just going to say, Hulk & Thor combination equals AWESOME and leave it at that. This movie defines MUST SEE.\",\n",
            "            \"The Avengers assembled flawlessly I'm sorry to say The Avengers isn't a good movie; it's a GREAT MOVIE!!!! It's not only the best team superhero movie ever made, but it may just be the best comic book adaption made period! The Avengers is the culmination of what began in Iron Man; and continued through The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America. It was only a few years ago that my son and I had just finished watching Iron Man and as the credits were ending, Samuel L. Jackson appeared on screen as Nick Fury and spoke to Tony Stark about joining Avengers Initiative in that short scene, the framework for potentially the greatest comic book movie of all-time had begun! Director Joss Whedon, most known for the T.V. series Buffy The Vampire Slayer, takes the foundation that was built in the prior films and brings together the greatest team of superheroes in film history, The Avengers: Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) as \\\"assembled\\\" by Nick Fury. Whedon's scripts usually include clever banter, gripping action sequences and an air of mystery and The Avengers is no different. Whedon has an utter love for comic books, and it is proudly put on display in The Avengers. The cast does a great job of bringing these iconic characters to life, beginning with Robert Downey Jr. Unlike Iron Man 2, in which Downey seemed to skate through scene after scene, Downey plays Stark almost effortlessly, delivering his lines with relative ease allowing his charisma, charm and smugness to shine through; Robert Downey Jr. IS Tony Stark! Chris Evans' solidifies himself in the role of Captain America. He was very good in his solo film, but truly owns the role standing alongside Iron Man and Thor. Chris Hemsworth's Asgardian god Thor has some incredible battle scenes and indirectly provides one of the film's most funny moments. After being seriously underutilized in Iron Man 2, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow is provided a back-story, which helps in developing the character and provides an opportunity to prove she is much more than just a pretty face; she's as dangerous psychologically as she is physically. I could envision myself enjoying a beat-down at the hands (and feet) of Black Widow. The character I was most concerned about being given little story and the least amount of screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye; happily, he's not left by the wayside and does a more than admirable job of developing the character. Hawkeye stands alongside Robin Hood and Katniss Everdene (The Hunger Games) as the best archers to grace the silver screen. I'd like to see more of him in a film of his own. Mark Ruffalo, the most recent choice to play Hulk, is far better suited to the role than Eric Bana (The Hulk) and Ed Norton Jr (The Incredible Hulk). Ruffalo looks more the part of the nerdy scientist Banner and plays the part without looking angry in every scene. In The Avengers, the Hulk is at his most impressive, both in his on-screen transformation and the violence he displays when the opportunity calls for him to \\\"hulk out\\\". If any character appeared to stand out a little bit more than the others, for me it was the Hulk. Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury is finally more than just the guy making surprise appearances. Fury is finally able to stretch his legs some, and Jackson slides quite easily into the role. Clark Gregg's Agent Caulson returns, and Cobie Smulders makes her Marvel films debut as Agent Maria Hill, and she is a welcome addition. The film's main villain is Thor's adopted-brother Loki, played by Tom Hiddleston. You would think the part would be a difficult one to play being opposite such powerful personalities and strong characters, but Hiddleston does a fantastic job; the performance should not go unnoticed, because it's one of the strong points of the film. Loki is not a villain without purpose and Hiddleston comes across as a devious mastermind without being cartoonish. At a running-time of 2+ hours, The Avengers is well paced and time flies by. The effects are top-notch, the acting is very good, and the script drives the movie elevating its strengths. For viewers that may not have seen any of the other films (and if so, why not!?!?), we're provided just enough information to bring everyone up to speed without feeling overdone. Whedon provides more than just a standard comic book film, but a story with reason that's backed up with incredible action and humor. Although the film is filled with larger than life characters, none are short changed; each character is given at least one great scene to work with, and the opportunities don't go to waste. The film's finale provides a deafening crescendo of action that is breathtaking. As usual with Marvel films, be sure to stay around for the post credit sequence, which provides a surprising reveal. I went into The Avengers with unfairly high expectations, due to all of those that were involved, as well as the films that came before it. After viewing the initial trailers and not being blown away, I had set myself up for disappointment. It was only a matter of minutes after the film started that I was put at ease, and just minutes later when my expectations were blown away. I never imagined that it was possible to put onto the screen, what I was watching. I'm happy that Marvel had the sense to keep these properties to themselves and to move forward with these characters in the manner in which they did. Marvel Studios and Disney are going to make a boatload of money off this film, and deservedly so; because there's never been another movie made of its caliber. Grade: A+\",\n",

Joss Whedon has created one of the most action-packed Marvel films to have graced the screen, full of humour, thrills and a great cast of characters, all of which impel this visual effects-driven spectacle. Whilst I had the great opportunity to watch this epic in the cinema in 3D, the film is equally as stunning on an average television set, with the final battle between the Avengers and Loki's army being one of the most spectacular scenes in a superhero movie.

A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to...

            "            \"Was it just me or did Dr Strange give us the finger towards the end? Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no...\",\n",
            "            \"Time travel is such a lazy way to write stories Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back.\",\n",

None of the \\\"demotions\\\" were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying.

            "            \"The writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product. I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before. In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights. And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it.\",\n",

            "            \"downbeat, overblown & so so long. Cuts all your favourite characters down to size Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future\",\n",

            "            \"Too long, Overrated, Mediocre, Badly Paced, Etc Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being \\\"king\\\" or \\\"leader\\\" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as.

            "            \"Maybe the worst Marvel movie? I am not a huge fan of the last Marvel movies. There are some very good movies, but the most is around average. Never so bad as most of the last DC movies. But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points? There was some humor and the graphics are looking good, but that is never the problem. And I see many people are happy with it, which I can not understand. But I do not need to. You can never make everybody happy, it is taste and interest. And for me this was a bad movie. Maybe the worst Marvel movie.\",\n",
            "            \"A horribly, boring and goofy installment. Worst one yet. This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because, versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons while the film piles on the feminist propaganda scenes.The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the Avengers franchise into a dramady sitcom.\",\n",
            "            \"Weak Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie. Highly Dissapointing Great Movie\",\n",

Action, humor, cinematography, heartbreak, etc. It was a culmination of 10 years of character development. The benefit of that hard work? The movie can start with incredible action and never let up. Most wouldn't agree because of the ending, but I feel it's the best movie of the MCU (so far). Endgame was awesome, infinity war was better. I think the best part of it was the fact that we had so many cool character meet ups that as fans we never thought we'd see. Thor with the guardians? Wow. Star Lord and Iron Man? Rocket and the winter soldier? We could go on and on. They also mastered the art of humor to help offset some deep deep hurt throughout the story. Thor and Star Lords interactions are pure gold. Thor calling Rocket \\\"rabbit\\\" pure gold. Dr Strange and Tony going toe to toe is worth the price of admission as well. I'm going to stop now or I could type forever.My only goal of writing this review is to help sway some others. Try to appreciate this movie for more than the gut wrenching ending. It's nonstop awesome from beginning to end. Enjoy!\",\n",

Of course, the film delivers impressive show values and action, but besides, it is above all the interactions of the characters that are well thought out. Surprisingly, no character is neglected, and all the storylines of the previous films are brought together amazingly logical. The end is for me one of the best cliffhangers of all time, after the movie I was whacked. In the end, I have to ask myself: What more do I expect from a comic book superhero film? I was perfectly happy, so I can also give a comic book adaptation 10 out of 10 stars.\",\n",

            "            \"How MCU should have always been like It was only after the release of Infinity War that I got interest in MCU. Before that I wasn't very much into superhero movies. So a couple of months after this movie released, I skimmed through all the MCU movies from Iron Man to Black Panther. I didn't put much focus into watching them all, since most of them were just following one pattern. Iron Man? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Captain America? A guy gets superpowers, beats the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and saves the day. Thor? A guy \\\"loses\\\" and then gets superpowers, beats the bad guy and saves the day. Even in The Avengers and Age of Ultron it's just \\\"now all those guys come together, beat the bad guy who wanted to take over the world and save the day\\\". But Avengers: Infinity War is very much different.The movie begins from where the post credit scene of Thor: Ragnarok ended. Loki dies in the very beginning of the movie while he was trying to unsuccessfully deceive Thanos. This clearly shows that this movie really means business. It's not afraid of killing off the characters we have grown to like in all these years. Thor's hammer has broken so he gets a Mjolnir. Meanwhile Iron Man's team faces Thanos in yet another very brutal attack. Captain America's team is able to get out of their imprisonment after the events of Captain America: Civil War. And in spite of having a huge threat looming before them, Captain America and Iron Man still feel guilty of what happened between them previously.Thanos is undoubtedly the biggest threat to have ever been shown in any Marvel movie, MCU or otherwise. Unlike the comics where he's just simping behind Death to show how many people he can kill, this time he actually has a motivation. And that motivation is so powerful he is even ready to sacrifice his own daughter for it. He has fought for many years to find the Infinity Stones, and there is no way that he will sacrifice his lifetime work over morals or ethics. Concepts like humanity, empathy, conscience don't hold him back anymore, as he was brought up by the Eternals and in spite of being treated as one of them, he chose to part ways. Mortals don't matter to him anymore. His ambition does.Every scene from this movie is shot very well. The story, the colour palette, the choreography, the costumes, the score, everything is absolutely perfect. The only part I had a problem with earlier was when Starlord learnt about Thanos having killed Gamora and then he punches Thanos till he wakes up and is stopped. But later on I realised that Starlord has always been an emotional crybaby, and this kind of a behaviour is absolutely suited on him. He cannot be expected to think rationally, considering his track record in both the previous Guardians of the Galaxy movies.And finally in the end when Thanos snapped his finger, half the universe was gone. Even though we did know that they are all going to come back, the emotions that were conveyed by the characters clearly gave signs that something bad will surely happen in the end. I won't be getting into the spoilers because I want to keep this review spoiler free. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just see who all disappear. Notice how they react when they disappear.Avengers: Infinity War is the kind of the Avengers movie I always wanted to see. I really don't like how The Avengers and Age of Ultron have aged so terribly (just like Joss Whedon's credibility lol) because of how campy they look by today's standards. Sure they did hold their legacy back then, but Infinity War will hold it for decades. It's the best MCU movie of all time.\",\n",

            "            \"Ambitious cross over This review contains spoilers.Avengers: Infinity War is the third movie in the Avengers series and is the culmination of the infinity stone arc that has been hinted at in the previous Marvel cinematic universe movies. This movie explores Thanos in more depth as well as utilizing all characters in the Marvel cinematic universe to resist Thanos' plan. The movie is about the event of the infinity stones being brought together and the heroic response.Avengers: Infinity War is a visually impressive movie. The movie is filled with dazzling special effects in every scene. The sound is likewise at the high quality as the visuals. There is not a weak part of the audio and visual experience. The movie felt like how the Marvel cinematic universe should feel after all of the movies. Thanos' character design resembles his comic counterpart and he looks as realistic within reason as a giant humanoid alien should look. Likewise, Thanos' children have distinct and great designed that allow the audience to pick them out in a wide frame.The problems with this movie lie in its story and approach-ability. This entry in the Avengers film series is the least accessible out of all of the Avengers movies. The audience must watch the previous Marvel movies or they will be lost. There is not a single main character or group that is followed in this movie. The only character that is followed consistently with an arc is Thanos. He could be considered the villain protagonist of the story, but he is still not followed as in a classic movie. The movie starts with the cross-overs and anybody that is not familiar with Marvel characters will be lost. Each of the characters maintain their traits in this movie. The guardians of the galaxy have their character when interacting with Thor, Iron Man, Spider-man, and Doctor Strange. The flip-side is also true where the Earth's heroes maintain their personality through the dialogue. The writers should be commended for the writing these cross-overs well. The movie splits the plot into separate threads where the heroes try different methods to defeat Thanos. Ultimately none of it matters because Doctor Strange already knows the only way to win. It was predictable that Thanos would get all of the infinity stones. What was not predictable was seeing which heroes would fade away when Thanos removes half of the universe's population. The movie's end was unique where the movie is not afraid to shock the audience with such a downer ending.Overall, Avengers: Infinity War is recommended. The movie is highly ambitious and is an interesting movie to watch for its universe. The movie does have some problems and it is highly recommended to watch previous movies before watching this movie.Grade: B.\",\n",

            "            \"A superior avengers sequel Although this film has 'Avengers' in the title, it ultimately belongs to Thanos. It's his story that drives the whole plot. He is the main characters of this movie, not any of the heroes. Thanos in my opinion is the greatest villain the MCU has ever produced. as a character he is truly threatening. In most of these movies deep down I know the hero will always win. For the first time I wasn't sure if the hero would win or not. Through the movie's entirety I was on the edge of my seat wandering whether my favourite characters would actually make it out of the movie alive. To have a villain with that level of genuine threat I thought was fantastic. I also felt slightly conflicted by his motivations. On the face of it, planning to eliminate half the universe's population is obviously a bad thing; however, after we learn his motivations for wanting to do so, I'd be lying if I didn't say I understood where he was coming from. There are two tones at play in this movie. One of them is a comical tone, mostly coming from the Guardians, Thor and Spider-Man. Predominantly though this movie is dark. Because of the level of threat created by Thanos, there is an emotional aspect to this film that will take the viewer by surprise. There are plenty of large scale action sequences, which are amazing; but there are also some shocking moments that were difficult to deal with. What I can say is that, the running time of two and a half hours absolutely flew by. Overall, Avengers: Infinity War did well in balancing the screen time among the characters in a way that every member of the Avengers get at least a moment to shine. There are also lots of great action, comedy, performances and a massive cliffhanger at the end that is well earned.\",\n",

And boy he doesn't disappoint. He is by far the most interesting MCU villain: strong, nuanced and perfectly performed by Brolin. This really is HIS movie. The film has a train like speed and one impressive sequence is followed by the next. Especially the banter between Thor and the Guardians and Iron Man vs Strange is what makes these Marvel films so fun to watch. Great climatic ending (a well ending...). As a stand-alone film it might not be as good as some others but as a showcase of what MCU has achieved, it has never been better.\",\n",

            "            \"An enjoyable ride Cool seeing them all together again, even if I didn't massively enjoy it. It's good, nothing more or less in my opinion.'Avengers: Age of Ultron' isn't too far off 2012's 'The Avengers', especially in terms of how I fell about it. I definitely wanted more from both, yet they are still satisfying superhero action flicks. I'd rank this narrowly below the aforementioned.Robert Downey Jr. felt a little flat to me as Iron Man - he still has a decent amount of moments, just not as many as you get in his individual films. All the others continue to entertain to an equally suitable level, I didn't overly like the characters of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen but I also don't have any noteworthy negatives about them. The story between Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo didn't do much for me either.With that noted, it is still an enjoyable ride through the 141 minute run time. The ending is intriguing, interested to see where that goes - I have a minor inkling about the mid-credits scene, given all the internet attention that has had - even for someone like me who knows very little overall.\",\n",
            "            \"Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) Review - 8.3/10 This film isn't nearly as bad as some people make it out to be. While the story isn't as good as the first Avengers, the acting is still just as good, the action is even better, and Ultron isn't a bad villain, he's just an under-developed one. Honestly, the action makes up for most of the flaws of this movie and it also set up a lot of MCU films, or at least foreshadowed a lot. Movies like Black Panther, Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame, and Captain America: Civil War. Overall, this isn't a bad film, at all, but it is the weakest of The Avengers franchise.\",\n",
            "            \"The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks \\\"illusion- woman\\\" and \\\"not-the-flash\\\"....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more \\\"the next few days of Ultron\\\". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new \\\"hulk buster\\\" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower.\",\n",
            "            \"Messier, for sure, but still plenty of \\\"Avengers\\\" fun The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's \\\"The Avengers,\\\" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.\\\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\\\" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of \\\"The Avengers,\\\" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in \\\"Ultron\\\" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.Yet \\\"Ultron\\\" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of \\\"Sokovia\\\" to New York to the African nation of \\\"Wakanda\\\" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of \\\"Age of Ultron\\\" is a non-stop blur.The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in \\\"The Avengers.\\\" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) \\u2013 also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch \\u2013 who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in \\\"Ultron\\\" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words \\u2013 it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.\\\"Ultron\\\" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with \\\"Ultron\\\" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.As \\\"Phase III\\\" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part \\\"Avengers: Infinity War\\\" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more\",\n",
            "            \"Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt \\\"People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds.\\\" - Jeffrey Eugenides Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), \\\"Avengers: Age of Ultron\\\" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful \\\"good warriors\\\" battle powerful \\\"bad warriors\\\". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes \\\"talk\\\", \\\"reveal their personalities\\\" and \\\"share their feelings\\\". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because \\\"films are supposed to have these scenes\\\". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clich\\u00e9s. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film \\\"comically\\\" delivers its obligatory \\\"one swear word\\\", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.Marvel Studios has a history of roping in \\\"irreverent\\\" and \\\"edgy\\\" directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, \\\"Age of Ultron\\\" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's \\\"Ultron\\\" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and \\\"cool dialogue\\\" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. \\\"Ultron\\\" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the \\\"Star Wars\\\" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new \\\"Star Wars\\\" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, \\\"Age of Ultron's\\\" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another \\\"anti violence\\\", \\\"anti military\\\" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.3/10 \\u2013 What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings.\",\n",
            "            \"What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now.\",\n",
            "            \"Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel! Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), \\\"oh look what they did with Black Widow.\\\" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her. Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War.\",\n",

            "            \"Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe ...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. The good:Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.The Bad:Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say \\\"It was necessary for character development\\\", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2.\",\n",

It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future\",\n",

            "            \"Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action. So everybody must be asking now: \\\"Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?\\\" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice.\",\n",
            "            \"Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free) Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time.\",\n",

A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.Well.... This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!\",\n",

            "            \"Another Monumental Marvel Movie! The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, \\\"get acquainted\\\" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. The moral of the film is, \\\"The way to peace is not destruction.\\\" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

This allowed me to sample pretty much every major Troma movie, and I discovered the meaning of the phrase \\\"guilty pleasure\\\". As I got older I stayed away from Troma, as their movies radiated the kind of feeling you get from wearing a shoddy Halloween mask too long and getting nauseous inhaling the cheap rubber fumes. But after sampling the delightful \\\"Tromeo & Juliet\\\" I decided to return to my roots and check out the directors edition of the classic \\\"Toxic Avenger\\\".While I was right in remembering the films as the guiltiest of pleasure, the cheap charm of the film was undeniable, and there was a ton of gore in the movie that I never saw on T.V. Arms are severed, guts are ripped out, seeing-eye dogs are shot, and children's heads are crushed- and it all looks pretty good! Some of the acting will make you wince, some of the jokes are atrocious (there are mother-in-law jokes), and some scenes go on too long (the idiotic out-of-control-car sequence) or too short (Toxie taking his revenge on his tormenters is strangely gore-free, which is explained in the director's commentary), but I can't bad-mouth a movie that has it's hero stuff a little old lady in a washing machine. If you're a gore fan with a high thresh hold for bad taste, then give the Toxic Avenger another shot- I did, and I'm a better person for it. I think.\",\n",

This film was responsible for keeping the company a float during this time period and it also marked a turning point in the company's history. For years, Lloyd Kaufman and company were making cheesy sex comedies. With the birth of the Toxic Avenger, they started to expand their horizons, focusing on low budget horror/comedy trashy spoofs films. Instant cult classics were being produced by Team Troma. The Toxic Avenger is a Charles Atlas tale gone a wry. A weak nerd is transformed into a superhero of \\\"superhuman size and strength.\\\" Melvin Junko is his name. Melvin was a mop boy for a local health spa. One day when a mean prank turned into a horrible accident, he was exposed to an open drum of toxic waste. That unfortunate mishap transforms and mutates Melvin into an avenger, a TOXIC AVENGER. Troma becomes a worldwide phenomenon and the Toxic Avenger becomes one of the most famous cult films of all time. A must for all campy cult film fans!!Highly recommended!\",\n",

Lacklustre direction by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz, a goofy script (by Joe Ritter), truly poor FX and even worse acting all add up to, for some strange, abstract reason, a stupidly enjoyable film experience.Maybe it's the camp sounding music, the over the top (and in some cases *way* over the top) 'acting', or perhaps it's just the fact that it's so unashamedly weird and downright cheesy that makes it such fun to watch, who knows? Whatever the reason this definitely isn't a film to spend long hours contemplating such things, instead just sit back and enjoy the crazy show.Performance wise, as already mentioned, none of the actors give even remotely decent performances, with the exception of Andree Miranda who's actually pretty good in her role as Toxie's blind girlfriend. All of the other actors are so far over the top (or indeed just so downright terrible) that by films end they too have somehow managed to take on their own distinctly cheesy charm and add greatly to the whole 'so bad it's good' motif.As I may have mentioned once or twice before 'The Toxic Avenger' is cheesier than a block of cheese factories, and as such it takes a special type of person to enjoy 'this type of thing', however for those with their tongue planted firmly in cheek, and for lovers of schlock cinema and 50's z-grade monster movies this is a must see. For most everyone else though it's probably best avoided and will most likely induce headaches and annoyance rather than belly laughs and amusement.

Though it's a typical B-movie, the premise is creative and I actually felt sympathy for the character of Melvin before his mutation. I know what it's like to be the underdog, so I was able to somewhat relate to him. So while some may have laughed at his quirky antics, I was too busy feeling sympathy for pool little Melvin. The film is filled with quirky, low-brow humor, which often works. I just felt that the premise wore thin after a while, and that's when the film seemed to simply go through the motions. Despite that, I had a good time and can understand why this is the film that put Troma on the map.

Why? Because not only does this not take itself even remotely seriously, it's hilarious to the point where the comedic timing rivals that of some of the most beloved comedies out there. The pacing is also practically perfect, ensuring there's not a single dull moment during the entire runtime. The only time where I started to feel the length was during the finale, but that's only because I was watching it late at night. Herz and Kaufman proved here that they knew exactly what it took to make an entertaining camp trash classic. It also has some rather well implemented social commentary, but never preaches to the viewer or makes them feel as if they're watching a \\\"message movie\\\" in disguise. \\\"The Toxic Avenger\\\" is certainly not for everyone, and the average person is likely to automatically label it as juvenile garbage with no redeeming values, but for those with an open mind and a strong stomach for pretty much anything, it's simply an absolute blast from start-to-finish, and if any of Troma's other films are even half as entertaining, I have a feeling I'm going to quickly become a huge fan.\",\n",

Its texture is not much different from A class/budget spoofs like police academy, naked gun, hot shots etc.this movie is an endless parody of movie clich\\u00e8s. Some people mistake targeted parody for poor acting. No way. I'm not saying it's an A+ Hollywood rubbish colossal, yet during the first part of the movie ( the mop man weakling made fun of ), you clearly see facial expression, mimicks etc are over the top & purposefully so.This movie has scenes that are copied, borrowed or else identical in super budget A+ later movies. Ex when the mop man bathes into toxic waste: Joker from Batman movies, anybody? Ex when the monster hijacks a car with two villains, killing one and riding the other at full speed to his death: the crow, anyone? And when the car finally explodes & the monster is unarmed: Terminator anyone?The blind girl ( Maranda is very very pretty ) affair reminds of Ben the rock man from the fantastic 4 in some comics.the scene where the slutty bimbo teases the mopman to wear a ridiculous outfit to arouse her, only to trick him in front of a sheep with bra in front of everybody, so he runs away in shame with all the overly exaggerated gestures is a clear parody of many culprit \\\"trauma scenes\\\" from more famous movies.The moral is all those glossy & fancy morons poking fun at the nerdy mopman are in reality drug addicts, weirdos, killers, hit&run drivers, pimps, pushers etc; so in reality the \\\"pathetic\\\" mopman & the ugly monster are much better than those scumbags.There is gore but not much & anyways not enough to bother an adult. There are a few girls who'd belong to a porn flick, a sauna masturbation scene & the monster has sex too, but overall it isn't more graphic than most cable TV crime movie; i'd say less.There is violence bar none: two weirdos cane an old lady to death; a dog is shot & the blind bimbo is almost raped (clockwork orange spoof ).There is also parody of more conventional items in superhero movies. Ex Batman hides in the bat caves; Superman in the north pole Fortress and the monster hides in a junkyard. When he gets the blues for being sick of mashing criminals, he & his girlfriend go hide in his favourite place: another dump. There you get a camping tent & she's in bikini.The monster roars & that's clearly an incredible Hulk spoof. To rescue hostages in a fast food, the monster faces criminals who are themselves a parody of the bad bunch: an horny Negro, a painted-face punk white and a third slick dressed white who faces the monster with some agility martial arts moves, etc. Again, parody of a bunch of clich\\u00e9s.The monster helps oldies cross the street; helps housewives open cookie jars (fun poked at conventional superheroes)I liked this movie very much.

Meanwhile, Toxie eventually finds romance with a blind woman who is unaware her boyfriend is responsible for the recent wave of gruesome vigilante killings (in essence, they're the perfect couple).A sick and depraved sense of humor is flaunted throughout this low-budget film project, which is in itself (to the politically-correct), an inspired, mean-spirited, overtly racist, funny, and completely, utterly insane cult flick that also reveals a slight penchant for animal cruelty.The acting is atrocious, the gore is plentiful and the low budget shines, but there's no question I loved this flick.

But the movie went on to become one of the greatest cult movies of all time, this is definitely a movie for those with a strong stomach and warped sense of humor.A must see!\",\n",
            "            \"a tinge of Ed Wood My 10/10 rating assumes that you like this movie before you've seen it. \\\"The Toxic Avenger\\\" is the ultimate movie for anyone into 1980s schlock. No doubt it was intended mainly for teenage boys (I lost track of how many naked women there were here). But overall, it's great to see a movie never self-conscious or anything like that (I mean, come on, look at that ridiculous outfit that the title character wears); the movie's really gross and proud of it. Troma must still be proud of this flick.Oh, and of course Marisa Tomei has a small appearance in the movie. Who ever would have guessed that one of the people starring in this would later win an Oscar?\",\n",
            "            \"Kick Ass Troma film! Rated R for Strong Violence/Gore,Sexuality,Nudity and Language.The Toxic Avenger is one of those \\\"so bad its good\\\" Troma made films.This is the only Troma film I have seen fully though I saw a bit of Class Of Nukem High.I saw this a while back on the channel Drive In Classics.The Toxic Avenger is a great movie.Yes it is cheaply made but it has a great mix of gore and comedy.The movie is about a geek who one day falls into a batch of toxic waste.He then becomes this deformed \\\"superhero\\\".He basically then fights crime while befriending a blind girl.The Toxic Avenger spawned three sequels, none of which I have seen.The Toxic Avenger is a great movie and if you like those entertaining \\\"so bad its good\\\" films, then I recommend it.\",\n",
            "            \"What's not to love? I was put off at first by the title. I like pollution and go out of my way to pollute the planet so I wasn't sure whether or not this low-budget comedy would have some underlying hippie environmental garbage message or not. Nevertheless, I decided to buy it... Oh my god, it was hilarious! Melvin is a lonely, awkward, ugly geek working as a janitor in the local health club, in Tromaville (known as the toxic chemical capital of the world). During a harmless if not somewhat cruel prank on Melvin, he gets into an unexpected accident involving hazardous waste, and hurries, terrified, back to his mom's house, where he mutates. Unsure if he can survive in society, he lives in the garbage dump on the outskirts of town... but it isn't long before he dons his mop and literally cleans up the town, getting rid of psychos, perverts, pedophiles, drug dealers and corrupt cops. He also falls for a very nice girl, Sara, who happens to be blind and can't see his mutated appearance.Aside from the constant crude humor, which I found annoying and rude, The Toxic Avenger is a comedic movie you just can't hate. From the catchy 80's soundtrack to the weird sheep kiss prank played on Melvin, the acting, the gore effects, the very original idea, this is a movie you won't want to avoid! I don't recommend you let your kids watch it, there are a few disturbing scenes, some violence, sex jokes, nudity, a couple of racist/homophobic comments and a rather misleading and stereotypical portrayal of the blind girl. Adults can enjoy the film while knowing better than to say these things, but kids could easily pick up various phrases from the film. A children's version of the film, Toxic Crusaders, is the better thing to show your kids.I don't know if I'll be watching this film again but I'm certainly going to view the others in the series! If you want something comedic, action-packed, low-budget and original, you'll love this.\",\n",
            "            \"the epitome Troma's best to this day, I still believe. Actually, I haven't seen the vast majority of their movies, but this has got to be the one on top. I love this! Deservedly the companies' most widely recognized film, it can't be ignored for it's willingness to go ahead and do whatever the hell it wants! The acting is completely ridiculous, but when was the last time you had so much fun watching??? The effects are pretty good, nice and gooey in all the right parts....If you've got a special place in your heart for satire, or just like bad, goofy movies, this is the one to see. All the pieces fall into just the right places.\",\n",
            "            \"Troma's cult classic This film is one of Troma's finest films that deserves to be a cult classic, the acting is bad yet funny since it's a horror comedy, the gore effects are good and the soundtrack is nice with some memorable songs like \\\"Body talk\\\". The fight scenes are pretty cool like the scene in the Taco Resteraunt that had some neat fighting moves. Some scenes did show the same scenes over again to pad the film up but that isn't too bad since they don't drag for too long.The make up for The Toxic Avenger is good and the effects for the gore are cool. The Toxic Avenger is one of those cult classic's that must be seen for some humour, horror, nudity and gore. Check this out.\",\n",
            "            \"Awesome Cult Classic, That Is Extremely Enjoyable, With A Fun Cast! This is an awesome cult classic, that is extremely enjoyable, with a fun cast!. It never takes itself seriously, and all the characters were pretty cool, plus This is the best Troma film i have seen so far!. It has great make up and Gore effects, and there is plenty of laughs, plus it features plenty of hilarious villains!. I admit i love Troma films, and coming into this i had high expectations, and i wasn't disappointed, as it delivered everything i wanted, gore,laughs, cool characters and a cool story!. If your looking for great acting look elsewhere, but if your looking for an extremely fun cheese fest, with plenty of gore and lots of laughs you have come to the right place as this film has plenty of that!. This is an awesome cult classic that's extremely enjoyable,with a fun cast, and i say it's a must see especially for Troma lovers (like me!). The Direction is great!. Michael Herz and Lloyd Kaufman both do a great job here, with great camera work, especially on a low budget, good angles, and keeping the film at a very fun pace!. There is plenty of gore!. We get a kid who is graphically run over,nasty decapitation,extremely gory toxic waste effects,guts pulled out,harsh bloody beating,gory gunshot wound,dog is shot (hated it),brains bashed in,ripped off arm,head crushed in half (Extremely gory), and more!. The Acting is actually not too bad for a Troma film,(still bad though), but it's a lot of fun!. Mitch Cohen is awesome as the Toxic Avenger, he had some great one liners, was a lot of fun to watch, had awesome chemistry with Andree Maranda,and kicked that ass!. Andree Maranda is hot, and was great as the blind girlfriend, i liked her lots. Cindy Manion is pretty good looking, and plays the slut well, however her acting needs a lot of work!. Gary Schneider is a terrible actor, however his performance is amusing as Bozo and cracked me up a couple times. Mark Torgl is amusing as Melvin the nerd, and did fine. Pat Ryan is terrible as the mayor and really played a poor villain. Robert Prichard is okay as slug and nothing more. Rest of the cast are adequate at best. Overall a must see! especially for Troma lovers! (like me). **** out of 5\",\n",
            "            \"Top shelf trash Mark Torgl's performance as Melvin Junko, a mop jockey at a Tromaville gym for jocks and sluts, is one of cinema's finest. You can't better his measured, heartfelt \\\"I don't smell nothing'!\\\" response to his boss's \\\"Melvin, clean up those toilets, they stink!\\\" line. This Troma classic, one of their few, is the purest of trash and highly entertaining. After he is humiliated and forced to wear a ballet dress, Melvin plunges from a third floor window into a vat of radioactive slop. When he emerges, he is uglier, stronger and more socially adjusted than he was before. After laying low at the local dump for a while, he re-emerges as \\\"The Toxic Avenger\\\". The film shows criminals harassing the innocent so Toxie can harass them back. The script is not Pulitzer material. There is a sick joy to be found in the various crime spree scenes. A restaurant robbery, which features the slaughter of a blind girl's dog and theatrical robbers, is hilarious. There is also a \\\"funny\\\" scene where a young boy is hit by a car that reverses and hits him again and again just to be sure. None of this is serious stuff, but the easily offended will be. Lousy sequels followed, but this is top shelf trash.\",\n",
            "            \"Great movie, Great movie Made on a low budget with a lot of brains, laughs and a complete disregard for good taste, this film finally makes a landing from the previously faceless Troma film group - becoming a flagship character of sorts.The picture features a nerdy, hopeless outcast who is reborn as a muscular, mutated green warrior with a profound, theatrical delivery. Stylized violence, mainstream attitudes about beauty and success and simplistic \\\"Hollywood\\\" moralizing are fodder for satire in this well made, and frankly bizarre film from Lloyd Kaufman's company.\",\n",
            "            \"It's Toxic, It's Independent but it's not a Waste. This little pleasant surprise came quite unexpected, and the reason why I love independent movies such as this, directed by Lloyd Kaufman and the reclusive Michael Herz, founders of Troma Entertainment in 1974, the independent movie distribution company for the low budget B-Movie genre. The Troma Company can be proud to have had the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Costner and the actress Marisa Tomei as early rising stars on their books, and with over 165 movies, to date, to their name, Troma Entertainment has become very entertaining indeed.With a strong zest for independence, shock, black comedy, sex and with a youthful cast, these movies have become cult figures that certainly deserve the recognition and respect amongst their peers and fans alike.As with their biggest hit, The Toxic Avenger is a clever filming of parody and sardonic humour. Is The Toxic Avenger a social comment on the narcissistic and materialistic and bigotry ways of Western society or just a plain horror movie parody reflecting on how society should be more tolerant to difference? This is the story of Melvin, the Tromaville Health Club mop boy, who inadvertently and naively trusts the hedonistic, contemptuous and vain health club members, to the point of accidentally ending up in a vat of toxic waste. The devastating results then have a transmogrification effect, his alter ego is released, and the Toxic Avenger is born, to deadly and comical results. The local mop boy is now the local Superhero, the saviour of corruption, thuggish bullies and indifference.There has been a lot of hard work put into these movies special effects, for a movie of this genre, it has worked very well. With the extremely visual talents of Jennifer Aspinall, she has made this movie virtually her own, her numerous Award winning flair on special makeup effects is astounding. There is also her movie pedigree to reflect on too, such as Spookies (1987), Street Trash (1987), the Saturday Night Live and \\\"Mad TV\\\" television shows, The Mexican (2001), Ticker (2001) and A Cinderella Story (2004) and others.Apart from the well thought out stunt fights, car chases, clever make up and witty script, The Toxic Avenger is, down to base level, a very funny movie, this has, no doubt, been used as a stepping stone to greater things for some here. The humorous gags, the amateurish acting, the experience in front of the camera, as well as behind, have most definitely not been a (toxic) waste.Seeing is believing, and believe it when you see it. Be independently minded and support The Toxic Avenger.\",\n",
            "            \"entertaining and hysterically funny Melvin, a dorky teenager who works as a mop boy at the Tromaville health club, is harassed by his peers which results in him landing in a vat of toxic waste. He then transforms into The Toxic Avenger where he endeavours to fight crime and bring justice to Tromaville. Lloyd Kaufman got the idea of setting a horror movie at a health club when he was working as a pre-production supervisor for Rocky. He then set out with his friend Michael Herz to make the movie under the name 'Health Club'. This later developed into what we now know as 'The Toxic Avenger'.The Toxic Avenger is one of those b-movies that is so well done in its execution that you can't help but love it. From the outrageous and over exaggerated performances to its tongue and cheek writing to its extreme graphic violence, it's got everything you want from a movie of this kind. It's self-aware of its outrageous premise and has fun with it by satirising eighties culture and pushing the limits of controversial content. It spawned a plethora of sequels and spin offs, even infamously a Saturday morning cartoon for kids which also resulted in toys and other merchandise. However, the original The Toxic Avenger is NOT for kids. It has sex, swearing, drugs and violence that I can imagine many parents at the time were shocked to find out if they didn't look at the R rating on the cover of the VHS. The Toxic Avenger is an entertaining and hysterically funny film that I recommend to fans of superhero comedies.\",\n",
