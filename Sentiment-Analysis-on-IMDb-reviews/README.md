# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb reviews 😊 😐 😔 😡

<br>

## Short description
Instead of using IMDb dataset available on net, I have fetched the reviews using IMDb API. I have then used NLP libraries such as TextBlob, Vader, Flair, text2emotion to analyze sentiments out of the reviews.

<br>

### Note :-
The colab notebook contains a detailed explanation about every step from making account on IMDb API to generating api key to creating requests in python to creating modal functions and much more. 

**By any chance if you are facing issues while installing packages on colab, just restart the runtime and run again. It should work.**

*Also the graphs are not visible in the preview of colab on Github.*
